This is a composer based installer for the [EK management tools profile](https://www.drupal.org/project/ek).

# Prerequisites

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

It's just composer, isn't it awesome? :)

## Installation of EK management tools

```
composer create-project arnaudom/ek_template:dev-master DIRECTORY --no-interaction
```

Composer will create a new directory called DIRECTORY. Inside you will find the html directory with the entire code base of [EK management tools profile](https://github.com/arnaudom/ek_profile). You should be able to install it like any other Drupal site.
